# Only.js Selector-based Loader
Only.js is a dynamic selector-based script loader that not only replaces the use of multiple `<script>` tags and initialization code but also with a fast,
parallel, speed-optimized API. Some script loaders tend to do a lot of things; from loading scripts, to loading css, to feature detection, to
loading iframes, images, maybe even solar systems &mdash; eventually.

The major characteristic of Only.js is not the ability to load all Javascript files in parallel with cross-browser execution order but the ability
to dynamically determine and load Javascript needed by the current page without blocking other assets/resources.
